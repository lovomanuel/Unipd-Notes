# Study Notes Repository

Welcome to my **Study Notes Repository**! This repository contains my personal notes for various subjects. The goal is to share knowledge, help others, and improve the quality of these notes through collaboration.

## Repository Structure
- Each subject has its own dedicated folder.
- Inside each folder, you'll find:
  - A PDF file named `Notes.pdf` containing the subject notes.
  - A file named `Suggestions.md` where you can list any **errors**, suggestions, or improvements. This file is specifically designed to organize feedback.

### How to Use
1. Browse through the folders to access notes on different subjects.
   - Open the `Notes.pdf` file to read the subject notes.
   - If you find something that needs correction or can be improved, navigate to the `Suggestions.md` file in the same folder.
2. Add your feedback in `Suggestions.md` by following this structure:
   - **Error/Suggestion**: Briefly describe the issue or improvement.
   - **Page/Section Reference**: Indicate the specific page or section in the `Notes.pdf` where the issue is found.
   - **Proposed Change**: Suggest how to fix or improve it.
   - **Reason**: Explain why the change is necessary (optional but encouraged).
3. Once your suggestions are added, create a pull request:
   - Include a short description of your changes.
   - Reference the specific `Suggestions.md` file where you've made your notes.
4. Use these notes **wisely and responsibly**; they are intended to support your learning and not to replace genuine study efforts.

### Collaboration
If you'd like to contribute significantly by improving the notes or even building on them to benefit future learners, please email me at **[your email here]** to discuss further collaboration.

If you have additional advice or ideas for pull requests, feel free to reach out via email as well.

Thank you for your interest and support! Together, we can make these notes a valuable resource for everyone.
